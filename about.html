<h2>A brief about me</h2>
<p>
My path to web development started in banking, where detail and accuracy were everything. As a former Funds Transfer Officer, I now apply that same meticulous approach to writing code. Welcome to one of my first projectsâ€”I'm excited to be building the future, one line at a time.
